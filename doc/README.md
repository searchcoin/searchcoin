Searchcoin Core 0.14.2
=====================

Setup
---------------------
Searchcoin Core is the original Searchcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Searchcoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Searchcoin Core, visit [searchcoin.com](http://www.searchcoin.org).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Searchcoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/searchcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/searchcoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run searchcoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Searchcoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Searchcoin-Core.
